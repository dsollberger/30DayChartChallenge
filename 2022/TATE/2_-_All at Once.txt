We were born without time, nameless in the arms
Of a mother, a father and God
When the world would wait for us, a thousand years in the crush
Of our eyes, fearless and awed
Quietly we'd fade in to sleep, with nothing on our minds

Then we longed to be loved, in the rush we'd become
Some things we thought we'd never be
We were surprised by how hard, left wary and scarred
From the nights spent feeling incomplete
And all those evenings swearing at the sky, wishing for more time
All the promises we broke when we tried, just wasting all our time

We grow old all at once, and it comes like a punch
In the gut, in the back, in the face
When it seems someone's lied and our parents have died
And we hold on to each other in their place
And I feel the water rising around us, and maybe that's okay
Yeah I feel the world changing all at once, I guess it will be okay

Then we all had one hope, there was someone looking down
To return our bodies to each other, and the ground

I've been in a daze
It seems like days that I've been waiting
For this dream to pass
It goes so fast
It seems nothing lasts
I think I've lost something

Stuck here with these people
While you wake I crush our bodies in one space
I feel your heart blood from my tongue
I wonder where you've gone

And the ever turning, spinning wheel of people, places lies I feel
The restless beat of the sleepless night to come
I just want to be numb
Just want to be numb

Hopeless these three years like smoking years
I go from place to place
Just endlessly and half asleep
Like I'm falling alone at some endless breach

I don't know where I am
I don't know what I've done
I just go over it again and again and again
I can't sleep at night
I cant breathe
But If I drink tonight I'll get you off my mind

And the ever present pit I feel
I'm turning on some spinning wheel
Of faces and the scenes I see
And none of it seems real to me
Just the bleary haze of the morning still to come

I just want to be numb
Just want to be numb
I just want to be numb
I just want to be numb
I just want to be numb

All these buckets of rain, I've heard enough about.
You say that I lied.
I am a gentleman didn't I ask for a place I could stay?
What were we both thinking?
The next part just got in the way.
You were just always talking about changing, changing
What if I was the same then, same then,
The same I always was?

All these things that you say,
Like I'll forget about the mind-numbing games that you play.
I am a gentleman, didn't I pay for every laugh, every dime,
Every bit every time and then you feed me some line.
I won't hear one more word about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man,
Same man, same man I've always been.

Days pass and turn into weeks, when we don't even speak.
We just lay wide awake and pretend we're asleep.
You go home alone and you're checking your phone
And you're looking at me like I'm something you own.

All these buckets of rain,
You can't forget about it,
You say I never tried.
I am a gentleman,
Didn't I answer every time that you call,
Pick you up when you fall
But you never listen at all
You were just always talking about changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.
Changing, changing
Guess what I am the same man, same man.

All of these grateful looks
All these grateful eyes
All the furious stares these fretful sighs

Promising everything
To everyone
We'll be back soon
You're my favorite one

And I'll keep it quiet
I'll hold you dear
The whispering fills the ear
Tell me you'll stay
We would have such fun
And the lie, you don't need anyone

And the screams, the wails, and the call
The headiness of the fall
Ten-thousand miles from where we began
Falling asleep with a picture in hand
It was all for a woman

You say that you're grateful for the time alone
Two years away and I don't miss home
And someone asks you if, you ever think of her
So you smile politely and you demur

But then all at once your head starts to swim
And you can feel her breath on your skin
If I let you stay, the same spot today
She's above you, below you in ways

And you're shivering cold
Like you're just ten years old
And she's lying asleep in your bed
And you're standing beside her
The light from inside her
Filling up the darkness in your head
It was all, for a woman

You've drowned in our teasing
You've forgotten the reason
The muse inspires the art
You'd give anything for
For her to say them once more
The words you believed at the start

Ten-thousand miles from where it began
Falling asleep with her picture in hand
And it was all, it was all
For the look in her eyes
Of the promise and the lie of a woman

I never knew my mother
I can't say it was so bad
She was still a girl of seventeen the night she met my dad
He was just six months out of Dhino
Trying his hardest to stay clean
And they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing
Like doves sleeping with broken wings
In a bed fit for a king
It didn't mean a thing

It was shot gun forest wedding
But they forgot to bring the guns
They were too busy counting promises
To the children not yet born
No one could afford the ride
They just hitched up the 101

And they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing
Like doves dancing with broken wings
With a view fit for a king
It didn't mean a thing

It was a loneliness
They would confess
Like the world had gone bad I guess
So they hold hands and look into the eyes of God
They'd say tell me why'd ya hide from us
Why'd ya fill the world with wickedness
Why'd ya spare us from your grace but not the rot

Now my dad says fuck the details
Just keep your head down hard
Ya got to find yourself alone before you'll find the eyes of God
You maybe broke and scared and mad as hell
At the flesh of your own heartstrings
But you were born to be a peasant not a king
So just stop acting like your running from something
Ya gonna leave the way you came without a thing
With your heart tattooed and your mind tied to a string

You just sing and you sing and you sing
It doesn't mean a thing

All these inanimate places feel like there changing
And the kids are lined up on the wall like they're ready to die
His forms ascending me its like they just rearranged them
We're all caged up like animals, questioned and ready to cry

'Cause I was just thirteen when I got my first taste of danger
Standing by the church I had a bottle and a pen in my hand
I said "father, I'm sorry, I just don't know what to do with this anger"
And this behavior is correctable, I know this wasn't part of your plan

Oh but punks like us we were always receiving instruction
And you could burn our clothes you could wash out the ink and the dye
But you can't look me in the eye and say you don't feel like a little destruction
And the kids are lining up on the wall and they're ready to die
And the kids are lined up on the wall and they're ready to die

All these days just seem like they're getting longer
The view from my room, its a gloomy and overcast gray
The weakness we left it behind seems to be getting stronger
I swear there's something in the air and I don't know what anyone could say

'Cause I saw the news this morning there was another
A boy the side of the road he had a gun in his hand
I thought oh what could you say to make it ever make sense to his mother
Oh man he was excitable, we were just trying to make him a man
But the day will come when it falls like a cheap house of plastic
And the cards that were dealt, will be tossed like a stone in the sky
'Cause you can only lie for so long before you get something drastic
And the kids are lined up on the wall and they're ready to die
And the kids are lined up on the wall and they're ready to die

Well it's another fine day of the nation building
Well let's have a parade
You can dance on the graves and the bones of the children
If you know what to say
And you know its begun from the beat of the drum
And the screams from the mouths of babes
And we pray as were watching the charade
Welcome to your wedding day

And it's a damn good day
For the heart and the mind
And the party is happening here
If you'll advert your gaze form the word on the sign
Let me wispier it in your ear
'Cause the sign says run
'Cause the sign says run
'Cause the sign says run
'Cause the sign says run
'Cause the sign says run

And you know its begun from the crack of the guns
And the screams from the mouths of babes
And we pray as we're watching the charade
Welcome to your wedding day
Welcome to your wedding

And we want peace
Yea we want peace
And we don't negotiate with terror

[Repeat x6]
We don't negotiate with terror

We only make or break
And we know its begun from the crack of the guns
And the screams form the mouths of babes
And we pray as we're watching the charade
Welcome to your wedding day
Welcome to your wedding

On the night that we met
You said that you wanted
Something more from me
And it was all that I could do

I remember your face, like a child
The way that you blushed and
The way that you smiled

Now it's all that I can do
And I wake up feeling new
There's so much more than I ever knew

So I think of all those years spent alone
It's like you're searching for something
To make you feel whole
Like you're half of something else
Like you're half of something else
Just a fraction of yourself

You take it so hard, we did what we could
There were no easy answers
To be understood
It was all that we could do
We're the only ones who knew
Now all I think about is you

The way that you screamed
The way that you cried
The way that you wiped your eyes
And fall against my side
The way that you told
Told me I was wrong
And the way that you'd sing
When you'd hear a song
And the way that you'd answered
When you knew I was gone
Now I know that I'm blind
And that you're all I see
And I know it's not clever
I just want you with me

I'm only half of something else
I'm only half of something else
I'm only half of something else

It was an old song,
From "Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me" that she sang.
It was an old line,
I kept with me, with me, with me when she rang

You're such a strange girl,
You're such a strange, strange girl.
You're such a strange girl.

It's all been embraced
Everyone is telling me,
It's slightly deranged,
Everyone is telling me.

We traded blindness for wisdom
And some lines around the eyes.
But you just act like it was a fact of life
It didn't come as a surprise.

You're such a strange girl,
You're such a strange, strange girl.
You're such a strange girl.

And no you can't ever go home.
Everything has changed and the people are gone.
So close your eyes and summon up the song
And you feel your life falling under you like a slide
Like a slide

It was an old song,
I once knew every note and every line.
It was a long night,
When I carried you and you carried me for a time.

You're such a strange girl,
You're such a strange, strange girl.
You're such a strange girl.

It's all been embraced
Everyone is telling me,
It's slightly deranged,
Everyone is telling me.

I dreamt of your face
And what the song was telling me
For time has made it all obscene
And trapped us in our dreams

I can only say these things to you while you're sleeping
I hear the hum from the wires the sounds of the morning creepin'
So I lie awake and pretend you can hear me

Tell that you're scared of turning into your mother
I feel myself turn into my father
We could lie to each other like they do and say we're so happy
It's easy when you're young and you still want it so badly

And I feel my heart pounding
And I think I might scream

I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
And I can utter every word that you ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

Tonight you whisper like a ghost and you look so shaken
You're so quiet and small and you tell me you want to be taken
I just never think of you as the kind of girl that would say that
You suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp

You eyes so wide, your face aglow
It's the face of someone I don't know

I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
And I can utter every word that you've ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

All I can think is that it must be a kind of rebellion
To arm your fears like soldiers and slay them

I can tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear
Thorough the din of your breathing while you're sleeping here
You wake and you ask me
If I'm going to be here forever, forever, forever

Your face so expressive
And your eyes a lie
I wanna to tell you I can change them
When you cry at night
But I'd be lying
Love is defying

The other day when we were walking by the graveyard near the house
You asked me if I thought we would ever die
And if life and love both fade so predictably
We've made ourselves a kind of predictable lie

And so I pictured us like corpses
Lying side by side in pieces
In some dark and lonely plot under a bough
We looked so silly there all decomposed
Half turned to dust in tattered clothes
Though we probably look just as silly now

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all this dog-eared innocence
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be
But you have no idea about me
Do you?

And it left me to wonder if people ever know each other
Or just stumble around like strangers in the dark
'Cause sometimes you seem so strange to me, I must seem strange to you
We're like two actors playing our parts

Did you memorize your lines? 'cause I did
Here's the part where I get so mad I tell you I can't forget the past
You get so quiet now and you seem somehow like a lost and lonely child
And you just hope that the moment won't last

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all this dogged innocence
I can't pretend that I can tell you what is going to happen next or how to be
But you have no idea about me
You have no idea about me
Do you?

So there's always a way around
There's something tying our feet to the ground
A moment passed we hear how it sounds
Then it seems a little less profound
Like we're all going the same way down
Yeah we're all going the same way down
I'm just trying to write it all down

'Cause I write songs and you write letters
We are tied like two in tethers
And we talk and read, and laugh and sleep
At night in bed together
And you wake in tears sometimes
I can see your thoughts flash across your eyes
They say darling will you be kind, will you be a good man and stay behind
If I get old?

And then the letters all pass through my head
With the words that I was told
About the fading flesh of life and love
The failures of the bold
I can list each crippling fear like I'm reading from a will

And I'll defy everyone and love you still
I will carry you with me up every hill
And if you die before I die I'll carve your name out of the sky
I'll fall asleep with your memory and dream of where you lie
Maybe better to move on and to let life just carry on and I may be wrong

Still I'll try
'Cause it's better to love, whether you win or lose or die
It's better to love, whether you win or lose or die
It's better to love, and I will love you 'til I die
