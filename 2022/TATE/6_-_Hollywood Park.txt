A73-581 was the number
They burned it in my brain
I could feel it in my veins
We could run, we could run, we could run
We were running away

And the fourteen dollars
I made on the bus ride from Chino
I laid it on the third
He was due and I was due
For a change, for a change
I'm tired of living a lie

And they were writing their names up in the sky
And we would watch them as they brought the horses by
And I felt like I was ready to die
When the bell went off and the races would start
At Hollywood Park

For fifteen years I had lived in a room
With my heart on my sleeve
And my throat dry from heaving the words
You can change, you can change
If you're ready to try

And we would laugh as the horses thundered by
And I would tip my brand new hat up to the sky
And nothing could come between you and I
As the horses ran wild through the dark
At Hollywood Park

And when they tore it down, there was a wrecking sound
And it rattled through my bones
And then a cry went out through the streets that night
'Cause we knew we'd lost our home

And there's only the wreckage
And this dirt still on my hands
And the roar of the ghosts
As they stood up in the stands

Where do we go?
Who are all of these voices I've never heard?
And what becomes of us now?
Buried in concrete and broken earth

As I stare out from the highway
At these miles and miles of graves
Under convenience stores and corner malls
All the countless roads they paved

Yeah I wonder if it's lucky
Or if you just forget the cost
Or the price of the admission
For all endless bets you lost

In fifty years I will dream o
f this moment from a bed
Tired from lifting, my legs
tired from drifting around
Through the dust, through the dust
In all the time that I would spend

But I never claimed I knew how this would end
Or the order of the horses at the bend
All I knew is I would be back again
And we'd stand here as the world fell apart

At Hollywood Park

I noticed how the leaves have changed
It's come to wintertime
I saw a bit of news today
I thought maybe I would drop a line

Brother how was the war?

I heard you met a woman there
I hope she makes you smile
All the shots they show of Vietnam
I swear I see your face once in a while

Brother, how was the war?

Did you get over?
Did you find what you were looking for?

She asks me all the time, she says
"Is he still alive?"
I remember all the games we'd play
You'd jump
You'd run
You'd seek
You'd never hide

Brother, how was the war?

Did you stay sober?
Did you find what you were looking for?

Brother, how was the war?

The days get so long in here
You wonder what you've lost and sold
All the bullshit passes year to year
Brother, did we get older?

I see the draft committee signs
McCarthy says, we're winning hearts and minds
But your 4F brother just hopes you make it back alive

I know I haven't written much
I'm doing okay, I guess
They say I make parole in sixteen weeks
I don't know, I'll try my best

Brother, how was the war?

The days get so long in here
You wonder what you've lost and sold
All the bullshit passes year to year
Brother, did we get older
On the day the war had begun?
When were we ever young?

Carry me somewhere far away from the noise on this damn TV
From the needle and the spoon in front of me

These straps across my chest make it hard to breathe
And I can't see
Through all these silhouettes
Can't they just let me be?
Wait and see when the drugs take effect

In the sky I see a sun
But I don't feel the warmth
From it or anyone
I'm too tired to think
Too tired to run

But I don't know what I'm trying to run from
All I know is I need to be someone
Take these arms of mine
Tell them what to do
Tell them how to pass the time
Put a charm upon this life of mine

And take this heart of mine
Tell it who to love
Who to leave behind
Tell it who to trust with these thoughts of mine

But I don't know what I'm trying to run from
All I know is I need to be someone

Who can laugh out loud
Who can stand a crowd
Who can sleep without these nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares screaming out

So carry me
Somewhere far away from this life that's waiting here for me
Give me something new
I need something new
That I can believe
Just something true
Please tell me who I got to be

But I don't know where that's going to come from
All I know is I need to be someone

Who can take this pain
Who can clean these veins
Who can make this change

Because I know I'll die
If I ever come back here again

Black lungs, headlights
Heading off to the city tonight, out the
Front door, turn right
I was alone, alright, alright, alright
I wonder what they'll think of me, I'll
Run away, run away
This is my town, this is my night
Heading off to the city tonight

And she said, "Come on, out with it, come on, out with it"
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it

Hard words on a hot night
I'll have a beer, won't you turn out the light?
From the front door I could hear it right
I'm just running dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb
I wonder if I'll be turning back
I got twenty bucks in a pocket with my stash
I'm not afraid, not your "good night"
I'm just a shadow of a shadow tonight

And she said, "Come on, out with it, come on, out with it"
Come on, out with it, come on out

And the night shadows watching
The darkness approaching
You came for a life in the park
So you stand on the stage at such a young age
As you're feeling around in the dark
And your mother, she's calling
You feel your hopes falling
And there's nowhere to run to tonight
Just his fist on your face now
You hope to replace how
the emptiness fills you inside

Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall

Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it

Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it
Come on, out with it, come on, out with it

It's late now, I think I'm gonna need this
So what, you say, you had your reasons
Our faces frozen on the highway
No turning back, no turning back
It's just you and me, kid, against the world, now
They're after us, they're after us
Now you want to tell me something, something?
I don't want to hear about nothing, nothing
I don't want to hear about nothing

Hey now, I don't want to be here now
All this silence is driving me out of my mind
Hey, mama, wave bye bye
We ain't ever going see that big blue sky
No one's ever gonna to believe us, leave us
Now you want talk about Jesus? Jesus?
Now you want to talk about Jesus?

Hey now, I don't want to know nothing about
All these curious phrases falling out of your mouth
'Cause I've been running
I've been running, now
Fifteen years I've had it coming
You tell me that you want to know my story?
I promise you it's boring, boring
Hey, little brother, want to know why
He caught a thirty-inch club right across his eye?

And now you want to be my father, father?
Tell me why'd you even bother, bother?
Tell me why'd you even bother

Can I just look out the window?
Where are the people I used to know?

Hey now, what's everybody screaming about?
It's going be fine if you put it out of your mind
But I've been screaming, I've been falling
I hear their voices calling calling
You tell me that we're going to be okay
We got fifteen hours and fifteen days

I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore

(Coming home)
"We do not have a potentially violent person"
(Coming home)
"We have a person looking for someone to tell them what to do"
(Coming home)
(Coming home)

Time stands still when you're always underage
So we learned to fake it like actors on a stage
Everyone we knew told us just what to do and how to feel about it
All our illusions fell
We knew them so well until we learned to doubt all of it

All the children know, if you jump, you fall
And if you jump too high, you fall harder than before
All the children say, "Why'd you let me down?
Tell me, when you going to come around?
I can't live my life underground
Tell me, when you going to come around?"

Calling, mama
Calling, mama
Calling, mama
Calling, oh oh
Calling, mama

Blue lights and shadows, we grew up way too fast
They stole our future
But they can't steal our past
Everyone knows that's where you go if you have to run now
If I'm not back by dawn
Tell them I'll be gone and I'll stay gone somehow

All the children know, if you jump, you fall
And if you jump too high, you fall harder than before
All the children say, "Why'd you let me down?
Tell me, when you going to come around?
I can't live my life underground
Tell me, when you going to come around?"

(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)
(Hold your tongue)

Stop staring, stop staring
Stop staring, oh stop staring
Stop staring, stop staring
Stop staring, oh stop staring
Stop staring, stop staring
Stop staring, oh stop staring at everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone

All the children know if you run, you fall
And if you run too fast, you'll fall harder than before
All the children say, "Why'd you let me down?
Tell me, when you going to come around?
I can't live my life underground
Tell me, when you going to come around?"

Calling, mama
Calling, mama
Calling, oh oh
Calling, mama

I was always in your corner
Patching up some cut
As the future and former
I like to think it was enough
All your words on point
Always talking some shit
As you rolled a joint
And played my new kit

They say the end is coming
Your sarcastic laugh, your fingers drumming
And tell me what we are becoming

Isn't it strange how the seasons just pass?
While you're lost in the farce of the past
And you always said this was enough
Then you cried while I patched you up

But I was lonely too
I was lonely too

We were never young
Just too afraid of ourselves
All the things we'd done
Trying to harden our shells

They say the end is coming
You grab my shirt, my fingers strumming
We both know we had it coming

Isn't it strange how the seasons just pass?
While you're lost in the farce of the past
And you always said you were so tough
Then you fell and I watched you give up

But you were lonely too

You were lonely too

They say it's so much better to have loved and lost
Than to have lived in a bubble never knowing the cost
Of a broken heart like a loaded gun
It scares everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Tells me the same thing every day
"You're wasting your time, just wasting away
There's a hole in your heart
Just go fill it with love"
But what is love?
What is love?
What is love?

What is this thing I've been told since thirteen years old
Where you feel understood, undeniably good?
It's a stain on your sneaker, a hole in your speaker
A feeling apart when you've emptied your heart

She's at the upstairs windowpane
As the young boy cries in the rain
She'll never know the power she wields
As the thunder falls on his ears
And he tells himself, "Never again"

All these engagements and lover's spit
As they grasp at a future and promise it
Will be joyful and fruitful, "We're better as two"
And I cried too, I cried too, I cried too, I cried
Hoping you'd hear me and see right through
All the endless denial I gave to you
I was childishly hoping you'd pull me through
I want it too, want it too, want it too

I want it to change me and lift me explain me and give me
A moment of time less alone in my mind
When I felt so strange you would hold me and say
"I'm stranger than you can imagine, it's true

And I'm yours and I'm yours and I'm here
And I swear there's nothing to fear"
So the young woman lies on the bed
While the young man hears lies in his head
And there's no one there and nothing left to be said

All these engagements and lover's spit
All these engagements and lover's spit
All these engagements and lover's spit
They grasp for it
They beg for it
They smother it and cling to it
All these engagements and lover's spit
All these engagements and lover's spit
All these engagements and lover's spit
They grasp for it
They beg for it
They smother it and cling to it

All these engagements and lover's spit (love is kind)
All these engagements and lover's spit (love is fair)
All these engagements and lover's spit (love is real)
They grasp for it (love is true)
They beg for it
They smother it and cling to it

All these engagements and lover's spit (I was wrong)
All these engagements and lover's spit (I held on)
All these engagements and lover's spit (I held on)
They grasp for it (I waited for you)
They beg for it
They smother it and cling to it (to be whole)

All these engagements and lover's spit
All these engagements and lover's spit (to be whole)
All these engagements and lover's spit (to be whole)
They grasp for it (to be whole)
They beg for it
They smother it and cling to it

I remember Jane
Lost in the park
On a February day
Was hours after dark
We were only eight years-old
But our hearts were open
Can you remember when
Our hearts were open?

Every night I'm lying here
The world crashing through my ears
I always hear the same damn thing
"You can't you're life hanging on a string"
He's always saying, "Stop complaining
You really can't ever expect too much
Boy, you were born with the common touch"

And we fall and fall and fall and fall
With our heads soaked up in alcohol
One hand on a cigarette
I swear I still got some good moves left
I've been fifty-eight since I was twenty-three
I got sixty-nine problems but one ain't me
And seriously I don't give a fuck
If my answer isn't good enough

Hey, there, tell me man
What's the answer to this riddle then?
Is it heroin?
Or Jesus Christ?
Big-ass books?
Or sleepless nights?
I had a few of those and everyone knows
That the common touch ain't worth the price

As we fall and fall and fall and fall
With our heads soaked up in alcohol
Two hands on our Juliette
I swear I still got some good moves left
And if you promise that you'll stay with me
I swear that I will always see
The best of you and me

Hey, now tell me this
How these days and nights can coexist
A million pieces in my mind
Every damn thing at the exact damn time
It always seems like the same damn dream
My legs don't work and I can't sing
I swear I don't feel a god damn thing

As we fall and fall and fall and fall
With our heads fucked up on alcohol
Two hands on my Juliette
I swear, baby girl, I'm not done yet
And if you promise that you'll stay with me
I swear that I will always see
The best of you and me

And when I wake up I wonder where everyone's gone
And I just can't sleep so I lay there until the dawn
And I wonder if god knows anything
Does god know what's going on?

'Cause I can't be alone just yet
And you're the only good thing that I got left
I know I got these problems still
But I swear it's real and I swear I will
Maybe we can't ever expect too much
But we can live here with the common touch

And we'll all fall and fall and fall and fall
Get all fucked up on alcohol
We're going to have a good time yet
Some got more, but some got less
And if you promise that you'll stay with me
I swear that I will always be
Something you can believe!

Yeah, they say that Jesus saves
But I couldn't write that on his grave
So I snuck his ashes through the gate
And I threw them on the outside lane
Where we watched the horses going by
Hoping to keep the pick-four alive
I was ten years old, he was forty-five
Number nine came through and we high-fived

I know it don't amount to much
But that's called love with the common touch

I lost my shit when I heard the call
Felt buried beneath the weight and all
Twenty-five tons fell on my chest
Every hour, every breath
You tell me every day that you won't leave
I'm sorry I put this at your feet
But tell me can't you see

That we fall and fall and fall and fall
We meet each other at the end of it all
We wonder where all the good time's gone
How we carried something so long
We made a little something that felt like home
So we could face the night to come
With that common touch, that common touch, that common touch
To make us feel less alone

I remember Jane
Lost in the park
On a February day
Was hours after dark
We were only eight years-old
But our hearts were open
Can you remember when
Our hearts were open?

It sure seems clear to me
As far as I can see
How the highest life brought the lowest out of me
Eventually

You're the reassuring kind
You're never really off my mind
Don't know what it means but it's sure a damn good line
When you're running out of time

True, true, true, blue

It was more than I could take
You got something that I can't fake
I fall down sometimes, I sh-sh-shiver and shake
It's so much worse when I'm awake

Because the truth is always wrong
And it's hard to face the dawn
When your days get short your nights get so damn long
So you just play along

True, true, true, blue

And it's true you're my best friend
We needed each other in the end
When there's nothing left to give
There's just some time that you can spend
You just tell me when
I know we'll be together then

I'll see you again
I'll see you again
I'll see you again
I'll see you again
And I'll see you again
I'll see you again
And I'll see you again (true)
I'll see you again (true)

True, blue

And they say it's "dust to dust"
You don't want to face it but you must
I won't ever let go and that's one thing you can trust
I'll see you in the dust
I'll meet you in the dust
