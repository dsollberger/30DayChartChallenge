All my young life
I've been trying to say
Just one thing right

And now we've come to the day
You're here in my arms
I don't know what to say

I believe I was wrong
Probably most of my life
Or I'm just hearing it wrong
I'm just watching the fire light

I see the look in your eyes
Am I trying too hard
Am I doing this right

So I fall
I fall down to my knees
I'm not easy to soothe
I'm never easy to please

I believe I was wrong
Probably most of my life
Or I'm just hearing it wrong
I'm just watching the fire light

I don't care if it's right
I know your friends are opposed
But we've still got tonight
We'll just keep our eyes closed

I believe I was wrong
Probably most of my life
Or I'm just hearing it wrong
Oh, I'm just watching the fire light

And I don't care if it's right
I know your friends are opposed
But we've still got tonight
We'll just keep our eyes closed

When I woke up today,
I got your message on my phone,
You said “Hey, I had fun,
Did you ever make it home?”
I tried to read between the lines
Oh, yeah I’m doing fine
Feels like my head if made of moonshine and cheap ass wine
My best friend told me I should just stop looking for a sign
So okay
You told me it was just a one time thing
A spark on gasoline
So what could I say?
If you tell me it don’t mean a thing yeah
Somebody told me you were mean
Then in a couple of days
I get this photograph of you
The message says you lonely too
Do you wanna tell me what to do?
I thought maybe it was a lie
When we spoke that one last time
Sounds like your breath is full of moonshine and cheap ass wine
My best friend told me I should just stop looking for a sign
So okay
You told me it was just a one time thing
A spark on gasoline
So what could I say?
If you tell me it don’t mean a thing yeah
Somebody told me you were like a machine
And so damn mean
My mind’s torn to pieces every time I try to jump up on this trampoline
Why don’t you tell me what you mean?
Why don’t you tell me what you mean?
Why won’t you tell me I was just your mistake?
How long can this take?
How many sleepless nights can I go over every second while I’m lying awake?
So okay
If this is really just a onetime thing
I think I’ve lost some thing
What else can I say?
I don’t blame you for a single thing yeah
Somebody told me I should stay away
But I can’t help it
I want one more thing
Silence is deafening
I can’t put you away
And I don’t blame you for a single thing yeah
Somebody told me you were mean

You keep me up some nights
Trying to figure what you mean
I don't know if it's right
I don't know what you're asking
When you laugh and you say
I was only joking

And it still feels wrong
I'm always asking these questions
Are you just playing dumb
And trying to get a reaction
When you laugh and you say
I was only joking

Got our eyes on screens
All of these dope machines
Isn't it funny how they feel so much like dreams
Am I trying too hard
Or am I trying at all

I see it in your eyes
I feel it in my bones
You coming out tonight
You gonna end up alone
Just so I could pretend
I was only joking

Got our eyes on screens
All of these dope machines
Isn't it funny how they feel so much like dreams
Am I trying too hard
Or am I trying at all

I've got three or four things
I've always wanted to tell you
I got two or three secrets
I don't think you could handle
Little closer to me
I was never joking

Come a little closer to me
I was never joking
I was never joking

Someday they're going to write about us,
Living here in the shadow of this gathering dust,
As the waves build up and drown the light,
While we're hanging from buildings on a Saturday night.

And the words she said
I could barely hear over the blare of the speakers and the smell of beer,
As she got up to speak, she lifted her dress.
I remember her face but I forget the rest.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we're all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

She said, "I got money, but I got no friends,"
As we drove through the valley in her daddy's Benz.
She said, "These pills wear off, but the pain don't end.
I never thought it would matter so much to pretend."

And the thing about her that haunts me still
As her hands fell down to the steering wheel,
And a shock of light fell across her face,
She said there's only two ways out of this place.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we're all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

And oh, I hope it's clear
There's no room for us anymore in the atmosphere,
But darling I always liked the desperation in your eyes,
The way you'd dance in the glow of the Hollywood Freeway lights.

Someday they're gonna forget about us
And we'll wonder if we were ever good enough.
It hit me last night, in this song I heard,
I remember the feeling but forget all the words.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we're all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

You're wide awake tossing
And you can't even sleep
With all these secrets you keep
The way home is so steep

And then it's midnight
You feel so alone
You've got your radio on
You don't know if you can face the dawn

And it's time to be a man
Tell me how does that go
What the hell are you waiting for
The whole world's at your door

All these lies there
You told to yourself
Like you don't need no one else
Don't put your pride on the shelf

And it's time to be a man
Tell me how does that go
What the hell are you waiting for
The whole world's at your door

And it's time to be a man
For the rest of your life
Won't you stop saying that you're over it, over it
You know that's a lie

But you were never alone
You were never alone

When she gave you
All that she had to give
You have to know where you live
Do you even know what you did

And it's time to be a man
Tell me how does that go
What the hell are you waiting for
The whole world's at your door

And it's time to be a man
For the rest of your life
Won't you stop saying that you're over it, over it
You know that's a lie

You just have to let it go
You just have to let it go
You just have to let it go

I held on as long as I could possibly
My blind faith pushing me to my knees
I felt the warmth of a touch
And it made me believe
And I knew it well

I stood at the doorway hoping you might let me in
My head spinning 'round
My nerves jumping from my skin
I felt the stinging ragged cold
Of the devil's hot embrace
And I knew it well

And you took me to hell and back
How many times can I walk away from you?
My mind's like a one way track
And every one is taking me back to you
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
And I know it well

I must have walked a thousand miles or more tryin' to keep you off my mind
I've knocked on a thousand doors I'm sure, just to see what I might find
I slept in the arms of a fallen angel cryin' next to me
And I knew her well

And you took me to hell and back
How many times can I walk away from you?
My mind's like a one way track
And every one is taking me back to you
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
And you give me just one more line and there's nothing that I can do
If I do it just one more time, then I swear that I'll be through
Yeah I know it well

And you took me to hell and back
My mind's like a one way track
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
Yeah I know it well

And you took me to hell and back
How many times can I walk away from you?
My mind's like a one way track
And every one is taking me back to you
And you tell me "Just one more time"
And you're lying like you always do
And you give me just one more line and there's nothing that I can do
If I do it just one more time, then I swear that I'll be through
Yeah I know it well
Yeah I know it well

Have you ever seen a map laid flat
Four corners pinned back
All the lines in the legend in black
So clear that you feared it was nearly all in your mind

And the phrase that fell from my lips left a rip
From the top of your shoulders to the point of your hip
And the feeling that you get
As if God exists he's really unkind

But it's not what you want
To say when you're losing
All the meanings lost in the choosing
The right side, the wrong side
The side that's been winning
Forget the words, look back to the beginning

My childish bride
Oh, how I miss your face
Sometimes I see my life slip by
Across your face

There's an ocean on land
There's a plan, there's a plan
There's a fifty foot tower running power over sand
There was a city on a hill, it was a thrill
But the lights are all gone

Now we stare at each other
Like a sister to a brother
Like a pusher to a shover
Like a secret to a cover
Like a lover to a lover under covers
With the stereo on

But it's not what you said
To me when you were leaving
Oh, this massive body as we're heaving
The right way, the wrong way
The way that they taught us
Forget your words, remember they got us

My childish bride
Oh, how I miss your face
Sometimes I see my life slip by
Across your face

Tell me are you real
Do you feel, do you steal
These moments you reveal
With those eyes that can't conceal
Were you wronged
Was your song just some clever thing that you made up

'Cause the words are just right
And I could listen all night
I could whisper, I could bite
I could write, I could write
I could sing, I could cling
There's not a single thing I'd ever give up

But it's not what you meant
To me when you were leaving
Oh, these massive bodies are heaving
The right way, the wrong way
The way that they taught us
Forget yourself, remember they bought us

My childish bride
Oh, how I miss your face
Sometimes I see my life slip by
Like a taste
Of death

The thing about dreams
Is that everything seems
Like you're riding a wave
That's been forming all day in your mind

The thing about time
Is all in your mind
Days turn to weeks turn to years
Turn to infinite signs
What you're leaving behind

And to hell with the rest
You gave them your best
You talked through your teeth
And the black cigarettes in your head

I always believed you were more than impossible
More than you seem and hardly responsible
For my life
From my eyes
Let's stay the night
We'll leave with the sunlight

The thing about me
Is I wanted to be
More than just friends
And hardly acquaintances
I, I wanna know why

Turn in your sleep
The secrets you keep
The things that you bury
So deeply, discretely inside
My, oh my

And to hell with the words
Or haven't you heard
Nobody says what they mean
'Til the second or third whiskey rye

I always believed you were more than impossible
More than you seem and hardly responsible
For my life
From my eyes
Let's stay the night
We'll leave with the sunlight

The thing about love
It's never enough
Circumstance changes
And life's always calling your bluff
Enough is enough

And when you sleep, you're alone
When you dream you're just one
Of a million small pieces
My darling, I see you, I'm one

I always believed we were more than impossible
You're more than you seem and partly responsible
For my life
From my eyes
And now I've said too much, I'm not giving up
I can carry the weight of this overflow cup
I'll just close my eyes like you're close to the touch
And I'll dream
Dream

You're not what you seem
You're not what you seem

She'll never know
When she tells you goodnight
The fear that you hide
As she lays by your side

When you stand
All the thoughts of a man
Etched right in your face
Still she lays there

How the warm
How the god in you so
Is the stuff of these bones
Once broken and cold

And you go home
And you sleep in your bed
Feel like you're dancing in sync
With the ghosts in your head

And she waits
You say, go back to sleep
And you dare never say
The greatest secret you keep

Is that you might be alone
That you might have to run
That the rest of your life
Will be a series of nights

That you spend in your mind
Staring backwards through to time
At something you lost

And you'll never be home
You'll never be warm
Eyes closed in the sun
On a warm day in June

But on the damp, dirty floor
Of your wintry cold room
YOu see a face in the dust
How it fills you up

And you say hello
Hello
Please don't ever leave
Please don't ever go

And you can call me a man
It's etched right in my face
But it can never stand
The endless expanse of space

All around us alone
Just this once my home
One brief moment of time
The only thing I call mine

It's this line that we cross
Now we came like a call
Of everything that I love

Midnight
I stare out the window from my room
I hear the dogs it's going to be dawn soon
I wonder where you are

In my mind's eye
I'm floating alone in the night sky
The treetops, the buildings beneath me
I feel my heart beating

So I try to find anything
To kill the time
To quiet my mind
There's got to be something
There's got to be someone

Else still awake in this city
I can't take another night
And I can't stay
I've got to break and break and break
These chains away
Away

The bars close
We stumble around through the echoes
Hiding our past in some old clothes
Like it's some dirty secret

And I see a face
In the passing light
It's so good tonight
I'm tired of putting up this fight
There's got to be somewhere
There's got to be someone

Else still alive in this city
I can't hide another night
And I can't stay
I've got to break and break and break
These chains away
Away
These chains away
Away

We lean into the wind
Riding our nerves and choking engines
Built for a time not 50 years old
I can hear them whispering at the door

When I'm alone in this cell
With 10,000 words and nowhere to go
And I wish you could know
How much I still need you

The spell of this town
The graves on the hill, lit up like a crown
The names on the signs
I can't even say
Have to break and break and break
These chains away
Away
These chains away
Away
