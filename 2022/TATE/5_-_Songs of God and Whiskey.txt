Sometimes I feel the pain
At the heart of this ember
All these ashes I choke on
Does anyone remember
Where we came from
Where we came to
A place with no center and no edge
And no end

Oh, and God just leave that Abraham alone
He wants a son, he wants a son
Everybody wants a home

Though I'm not quite sure if poor Isaac would agree
My God, he said what did I do
To make you want to watch me bleed

And I feel sick tonight
I feel just like
The dancing flame of a funeral light
And I'm not sure if I want you to save me

And I'd be less uptight
If I knew the sight
Of blood was just a weakness
And not the whole reason that you made me
'Cause sometimes I think it is

Oh, and God just go and leave me all alone
I'm not your son, I'm not your son
Everybody dies alone

Was this world just not quite hard enough for you
I guess like anyone, you've got
Your own scores to settle too

And I'm so pissed tonight
I feel just like
The last remaining Canaanite
And I don't think that I will be returning

And if you want to see the irony
And the savage price of piety
There's a lot of us who are going to be burning
How does it feel?

And the sorrow that I know when I'm alone I can't express
All these darling angels singing in my ear
And the comfort of their touch, it cuts right through this emptiness
And it's everything I want
And everything I fear

Well, I don't fear God

And that child was my friend
I spent a long time with his curse
I can feel him trembling beneath his plea

I don't know if there's a water
All I know is there's a thirst
And it might be for the best
But I'm not quite sure if Isaac would agree

And the second time
You asked me to do the line
You offer it so graciously
So I think, what harm could befall me

Are you sure that this won't last?
Like other stuff that sure works fast
It's like opening a vein
And bleeding out my brain, brain, brain

I love you too
But I really love your shoes
You look stunning decked in red
Wait, what was it that I said?

And we were happy to be alive
Are you frightened some day you'll die?
Are you sharp, are you dull?
Are you that tiny sober dot
At the center of my fevered skull?
Oh, no

When the conversation ends
What happens when the conversation ends?
Oh, tell me when the conversation ends
Oh, please don't let this conversation ends

Do you like to read, do you like to ski?
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut, do you like me?
Do you always quote Dostoevsky?
Or only when you snort a key, key, key?

I feel so sick
Please don't tell me this is it
And you gave me such a fright
And let's dance like ghosts
Let's haunt ourselves tonight

When I was a boy
My daddy told me, son
Don't you ever mess with a certain type of girl

Now I've wished more than twice
I had taken dad's advice
I wish it more than anything in this world

He'd grab himself a bottle
And he'd look me in the eye
And he'd take a plug and he'd wipe it from his chin

He said, son don't put much part
In those matters of the heart
I wish I had listened to him

And tell me you're Jesus
I'm asking you please
How do I make this endless heartache cease
Lord, I'd believe in you
If you'd believe in me too
And I just want a little peace
Come on, now

Us big city boys
We don't think about it much
It's all whiskey, wine, and messing around with drugs

All these secrets that we keep
Never knowing where we'll sleep
I guess I always thought it was enough

But I've this feeling in my heart
These days of wanting more
Something to ease this weary head

So, I guess I thought that girl
Might redeem me from this world
Lord, I should have asked you instead

And tell me you're Jesus
I'm down on my knees
I know that I'm no Lord suffering priest
But I'd believe in you
Could you believe in me too?
And I just want a little peace
Oh Lord, I just need a little peace

You're totally ignoring me, she said
As she put on her shirt
I was lying on the bed
Concentrating on her skirt
And did you hear one word I said, she said
I don't know it's all a blur
I close my eyes

And we fell in love in a great big rush
Three years ago this June, I do recall
Playing arcade games with her
And wanting nothing at all
Just this silly, skinny girl who tended
To trip and fall on her lies

But then summer came
And we felt the strain
Of the damning things we said
All the summer rains like hurricanes
That flew around our heads
All the endless conversations, you know
Like the things you could have done alone
Instead, instead, instead, instead, instead

So I fucked it up like I always do
I was born to be alone
I don't even know if the words were true
But I screamed into the phone
All I know is everybody leaves
Or so it seems to me when I'm alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone

But I was younger then and stronger then
Somehow I can't explain
How these years can be so humbling
So strangely full of pain
Just how everyone and everything must
Change and change and change and change
And change and change and change

Just like that

'Cause sometimes I feel just like a train
That's running off the tracks
And sometimes I think I've said too many
Things I can't take back
And sometimes it seems like everything
I do is just a waste
In fact, that's it
I think, oh wait, I'm sure

But I'm trying every morning that I wake
To stand up straight
And to always tell the truth
And give back more than I take
And to be kind and pure
Less fucking scared of everything
I just can't take
Much more of this, I'm sure

We imagined ourselves
As cathedral bells
Ringing out through the moribund streets
Like shrill courtesans
Making fanciful plans
That we whispered while drifting to sleep

And I told you I'd stay
In every possible way
Though we both knew that that wasn't true
You said "You would understand
If it was something so grand
As a mirrored reflection of you"

And New York in October
Was never so sober
As the beating on the windows in March
Trying so hard in vain
To stay out of the rain
Falling off our cathedral arch

You were Zelda, Isolde, you were Audrey and Kate
You were Miss Cleopatra in heels
And anonymously
You were April to me
Throwing rocks just to see how it feels

But those lines in your eyes
And that platinum crown
And that gaudy red rogue on your cheeks
You must look so sublime
With some Neophyte charm
But you look like a common whore to me

But I liked you the best
In your plain simple mess
Drinking wine from a pink, plastic cup
While the radio played
Some soft serenade
And we noticed the sun coming up

And the blue in your eyes
Looked like ice when you cried
And you always felt so cold when we touched
Happy birthday to you
I sure hope it's not true
Even though I don't miss you that much

Oh the lines of the cars
At the college at night
All their pillows, their blankets
Their posters and lights
All their hopelessly young faces
Tired with the solace of years

And you look at me blankly
Did I miss something?
All these kids seem to be
Less like ghosts on the ring
Of the graveyard we've built
From the sting of these horrible fears
And I try not to laugh as it brings you to tears

But I won't tell your secret
If you won't tell mine
I'll just speak quietly
As a well rehearsed line
My, but how time makes one long for such ignorant peers
And you grab hold of my hand as I whisper in your ear

On the day that you die,
Please remember these words
You were the luckiest gift
That I'll never deserve
I can feel you and me
Like my heart beat And blood stream in turns

And it's desperate, I know
But please don't let go
I can't begin to repay
All these debts that I owe
I'm just a sketch of a man
I'll let you know when I sharpen the blurs

I have hurt you, deserted you, left you alone
With your loneliness to wear
Like a crown on a throne
I'm as selfish and trite as anything god's ever known

Oh but don't be afraid,
'Cause I'm going down too
When I finally fade
I'll be fading with you
I'll just hold onto your hand
God, I wish there was more I could do

And these kids have no clue
It's all happening too
Let's not tell them
Let's pretend it's just me and you
We'll find out soon enough
But by then we'll be dust on their shoes

And these kids have no clue
It's just me and you
Let's not tell them
Let's pretend it's happening too
We'll find out soon enough
But by then we'll have nothing to lose

I'll just hold onto your hand,
God, I wish there was more I could do

Everyday at sunrise I got to
Empty my pockets, I got four
Cups of coffee in these empty sockets
And the dreams I have so tender loom
In the air around my bedroom
I think about the rising sun
And the day to come
And I wonder where you went, where you went
Are you wide awake
Did you read all the letters that I sent
Are you fast asleep
Did you know I keep
Your memory
Buried away so deep

'Til all the walls fall
We'll just keep being strangers
As the world rearranges
Every blade, every seed, every ounce of greed
And the sunrise is a welcome thing
But I wish it was more welcoming
'Cause this life has such an awful sting
And a price to pay for everything

And everyday they say
Just get away
They say just get back up
They say just stand tough
You've got to keep it up
You've got to learn to play rough
You've got to run through a field on a sunlit day
Laugh it off then sleep at night

But, I don't care
I just don't care
'Cause if you're not here
There's no one to laugh at the jokes we share
Are you fast asleep
Did you know I keep
Your memory
Buried away so deep

'Til all the walls fall
We'll just keep being strangers
As the world rearranges
Every blade, every seed, every ounce of greed
And the sunrise is a welcome thing
But I wish it was more welcoming
'Cause this life has such an awful sting
And a price to pay for everything

I saw you last night
In the cell where I sleep
And your shyness was such a surprise
And you said I hold you in me
Like a secret I keep
And the truth of that moment defies all that we know
Oh, oh, oh
where'd we go
Oh, oh, oh

So I think
'Til all the walls fall
I'll just keep getting stranger
The world will rearrange her
Into something just as beautiful
I know that I won't know you then
But I see no reason to pretend
'Cause I love you now and I'll love you then
And the sun will shine on everything

And oh
'Til all the walls fall
We'll just keep being strangers
And the world will rearrange us
Into things we never planned to be
As the sunrise is around us
It continues to confound us
Its beauty will surround us
And share its light with everything

It was a summer's day when you first walked away
At the time I wasn't feeling so bad
You gave me shit while I looked away
Just like every big conversation that we ever had
And you know how a thing like that
Can be such a terrible shame
'Cause it makes you feel mean
Your eyes were so very green

And it's foolish to think
You would ever consider it again
After two or three drinks
All the books on the subject say
Just move along, give yourself some time to think
They say follow your heart
What if your heart never knew where to go?
Oh, why

You're just saying goodbye
To people, 'cause every word is just a lie
Like a guilty man who knows he's gonna fry
I was hoping to catch that old dreamy look in your eye

And it's foolish to need any sign
You consider me again after smoking some weed
All our friends supportive
Even every tired and desperate word we'd ever plead
They say follow your heart
What if your heart never knew where to go?
Oh, why

You're just saying goodbye
To people, 'cause every word is just a lie
And you wonder just a little if your soul doesn't start to die
And you spend every waking moment wondering why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why

It was a winter's day when I finally
Realized I was the one always walking away
That you'd tried so many times
And I'd ignored every word that you had to say
And you know how a thing like that
Can be such a terrible shame
'Cause it makes you feel old
And your words were so very cold

And it's foolish to think
You can bury it all in some endless drive to drink
Every person you meet can tell
You're a ship taking water in a storm and you're starting to sink
If you follow your heart
Then you're bound to become something else
You take one hard look at yourself

And you say I
Do everything you said that I couldn't do when I was high
And I'll write your name in stars across the sky
And we'll meet somewhere someday and you'll ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why

Someday they're going to write about us,
Living here in the shadow of this gathering dust,
As the waves build up and drown the light,
While we're hanging from buildings on a Saturday night.

And the words she said
I could barely hear over the blare of the speakers and the smell of beer,
As she got up to speak, she lifted her dress.
I remember her face but I forget the rest.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we're all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

She said, "I got money, but I got no friends,"
As we drove through the valley in her daddy's Benz.
She said, "These pills wear off, but the pain don't end.
I never thought it would matter so much to pretend."

And the thing about her that haunts me still
As her hands fell down to the steering wheel,
And a shock of light fell across her face,
She said there's only two ways out of this place.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we're all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California.

And oh, I hope it's clear
There's no room for us anymore in the atmosphere,
But darling I always liked the desperation in your eyes,
The way you'd dance in the glow of the Hollywood Freeway lights.

Someday they're gonna forget about us
And we'll wonder if we were ever good enough.
It hit me last night, in this song I heard,
I remember the feeling but forget all the words.

Here in California, I was
Just a name and a number, a face on a tumblr.
Here in California, we're all stuck in the same scene,
All nightmares and daydreams
In California

Whatever happened to the fall of Rome
What a strange thing to ask when I was taking you home
As we walked alone through the parking lot
I said I don't have much, you said I like what you got

And I'd be lying if I said I didn't picture you then in your wedding dress
And the days I hoped we'd some day spend in our Sunday best
We were light as a flame
Both bat shit insane
We were lost, but we were just the same

Whatever happened to the fall of Rome
You were a mystery to me, but the place felt like home
And there are no rules when you're falling in love
You just take what you get, and you hope it's enough

And I'd be lying if I said I didn't picture you then in your wedding dress
And the days I hoped we'd some day spend in our Sunday best
We were wrong from the start
With our broken arms
You played your role, and I played my part

And the road was so long
I was never as strong
As the love that you gave to me
And it all took it's toll
You become so cold
You forget what you were born to be

Whatever happened to the fall of Rome
Those people all turned to ashes and stone
It's a trick of the mind when you think it won't end
it's a contest with time that time always wins

I saw a picture of you the other day in your wedding dress
And I wondered why I'd walked away like I had with the rest
You were the only thing
That was worth saving
And I swear I did my best

And sometimes at night I dream of you now in your wedding dress
And I hope it doesn't seem somehow like I gave you less
I have nothing to show
From these years on the road
But these songs that I wrote for you
